1. The homescreen contains two buttons, namely Generate Random Number and Microphone Input.

3. The Microphone Input button redirects to a new activity that has a start button and a stop button.
4. It records the audio input from the phone's mic when start is clicked, displays it as a waveform and saves the audio to Firebase when stop is clicked.
5. The exit button on that activity redirects it to the homescreen.
